A landing website for the Swiss startup company Be12, presenting their product: A secured end-to-end encrypted data vault, coined as a **Databank**.

The website consists of several sections,
- Introducing the company values and main strengths.
- Product presentation, features and functions.
- Detailed review of security used.
- Pricing calculator.

The Log In button redirects the user to the Be12 Webapp page. If the user has the 2-factor Authentication configured, it waits for the user to accept the login petition on their mobile app and then redirects them to the web app.

The website supports localization and was translated into 5 languages(English, German, French, Spanish and Catalan).

Several techniques were utilized, such as parallax, appear-on-scroll and customized formulas for the pricing calculator.

### Deeper dive
The website is a showcase of the products and services provided by the company, in which I participated actively and was heavily invested. The products offered were the iOS Authenticator application (Be12 Code) and the Web app platform (Swiss Databank).

I was involved in several stages of these projects, working with the design department ([Abstract](https://www.abstractbranding.com)) and stakeholders, from naming strategy, copywriting, paperwork content, pricing, ... to website layout and web app layout.

The idea of **Be12** is to emphasize on data privacy and security for companies. Utilizing state-of-the-art cryptographic systems and two-factor authentication systems, the platform provides a private and safe area for the userâ€™s data stored in a data centre in Switzerland.


<sub>*Fun fact: The name Be12 was a nod to the 12th article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:*</sub>
> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
