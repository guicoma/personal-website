A landing website for the Swiss startup company Be12, presenting their product: A secured end-to-end encrypted data vault, coined as a **Databank**.

The website consists of several sections,
- Introducing the company values and main strengths.
- Product presentation, features and functions.
- Detailed review of security used.
- Pricing calculator.

The Log in button redirects the user to the Be12 Webapp page. If the user has the 2-Factor Authentication configured, it waits for the user to accept the login petition on their mobile app and then redirects them to the webapp.

The website supports localization and was translated into 5 languages(English, German, French, Spanish and Catalan).

Several techniques were utilized, parallax, appear on scroll and customized formulas for the pricing calculator.

### Deeper dive
The website is the showcase of the products of the company, in which I participated actively and was heavily invested in. The products were the iOS Authenticator application (Be12 Code) and Webapp platform (Swiss Databank).

I was involved in several stages of these projects, working together with the design department ([Abstract](https://www.abstractbranding.com)) and stakeholders, from naming strategy, copy-writing, paperwork content, pricing, to website layout and webapp layout.

The idea of **Be12** was to emphasize on data privacy and security for companies. Using state-of-the-art cryptographic systems and two-factor authentication systems to provide a private and safe area for the user's files and having ownership of the data which were stored in a datacenter in Switzerland.


<sub>*Fun fact: The name Be12 was a nod to the 12th article of universal declaration of human rights:*</sub>
> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.


#### Seal of excellence - H2020
In 2018 we presented the project to the European Commission for their research and innovation funding programme [**Horizon 2020**](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/816449). We achieved the seal of excellence and were granted funding during the first phase of the programme. Together with [SOROS Gabinete](https://www.sorosgabinete.com) we presented the documentation of the programme. I participated in the redaction, revision and submission of the project in the EU online platform.
