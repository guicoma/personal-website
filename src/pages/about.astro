            I have many hobbies and passions, some have come and gone, other's
            have stuck. Ranging from stamp collecting and crafting model
            airplanes, to photography and hiking.

            Nevertheless computers, consoles and gadgets have always been part
            of the househould ever since I was a child. It's a safe bet to say
            that those things got me interested in programming and gaming at an
            early age.

            I really enjoy puzzles and challenges that get that head of ours to
            think of creative solutions.
